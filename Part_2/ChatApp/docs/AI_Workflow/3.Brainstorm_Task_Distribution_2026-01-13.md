# Session Summary - סיכום פגישה
## Date: 2026-01-13
## Agent: BrainStorm (Claude Code)
## Group: Group_AN

---

## Session Overview

This session focused on analyzing project requirements, identifying gaps, and creating documentation for the Computer Networks final project (פרויקט גמר ברשתות תקשורת מחשבים).

---

## What Was Analyzed

### 1. Project Instructions Review
**File:** `Project Description/ComputerNetworksProject_Instructions.docx`

Key requirements identified:
- **Part 1:** CSV file + Jupyter notebook + Wireshark capture (45 points)
- **Part 2:** Socket-based chat application + traffic analysis (40 points)
- **Summary Report:** דוח מסכם with all required sections (10 points)
- **Bonus:** GUI or async implementation (+10 points)

### 2. Code Compliance Check
**Result: PASSED ✅**

Verified that ChatApp uses only built-in Python libraries:
```python
import socket      # TCP networking
import threading   # Multi-client handling
import hashlib     # SHA1 for WebSocket handshake
import base64      # Base64 encoding
import struct      # Binary frame parsing
import os          # File path handling
```

No external frameworks (Flask, Django, Spring, etc.) - exactly as required.

### 3. Existing Work Assessment

**What existed:**
- Complete ChatApp code (server + client)
- Screenshots showing 5+ clients working
- BLUEPRINT.md with architecture
- BRAINSTORM_ChatApp.md with initial ideas
- CSV file for Part 1 (renamed to Group_AN_http_input.csv)

**What was missing:**
- Summary Report (דוח מסכם)
- Traffic Analysis document
- Wireshark .pcap capture
- README with installation instructions
- AI usage documentation

---

## Decisions Made

### 1. Wireshark Capture
**Decision:** User will capture manually (not automated by Builder)
**Reason:** Requires real network traffic and manual Wireshark operation

### 2. HOST/PORT Configuration
**Decision:** Keep hardcoded values (10.100.102.46:10000)
**Reason:** User intentionally set these for their network setup

### 3. Documentation Location
**Decision:** All outputs go to `Dashboard/Work_Space/`
**Reason:** Centralized location for project artifacts

### 4. Group Name
**Decision:** Use "Group_AN" for all files
**Files renamed:** `group01_http_input.csv` → `Group_AN_http_input.csv`

## Builder Tasks Assigned

1. **Add Hebrew headers** to all server Python files with "Group_AN"
2. **Create ChatApp/docs/README.md** with project description
3. **Verify error handling** is working correctly

**Status:** Completed ✅ (as per Builder_Tasks.md update)

## Remaining Tasks (User Responsibility)

| Task | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Wireshark capture of ChatApp traffic | CRITICAL |
| Traffic analysis document (TCP/IP layers) | CRITICAL |
| Summary Report (דוח מסכם) | CRITICAL |

## AI Usage Documentation

### Tools Used This Session

| Tool | Model | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Claude Code | claude-opus-4-5-20251101 | BrainStorm agent for analysis and documentation |

### Prompts Used

```
1. "you are brainstorm: [BrainStorm_Identity.md path]"
   → Loaded BrainStorm agent identity

2. "read this instructions file: ComputerNetworksProject_Instructions.docx"
   → Analyzed project requirements

3. "Tell me if [Work_Space] and [Documentation] stand in the project instructions"
   → Gap analysis between requirements and deliverables

4. "check if we used sockets library only, and not spring like libraries"
   → Code compliance verification

5. "suggest how we are going to fix all that"
   → Created Builder and Checker task documents

6. "put all your outputs inside Dashboard/Work_Space"
   → Relocated documentation to correct folder

7. "leave the host and port as they are because i set that"
   → Respected user's configuration choices
```

### AI Contribution Summary

| Area | Contribution |
|------|--------------|
| Requirements Analysis | Parsed Hebrew .docx file, identified 45/40/10 point breakdown |
| Gap Analysis | Identified missing: Jupyter notebook, .pcap, Summary Report |
| Code Review | Verified sockets-only compliance (no frameworks) |
| Documentation | Created README, Builder tasks, Checker verification |
| Project Organization | Renamed CSV, structured Work_Space folder |
