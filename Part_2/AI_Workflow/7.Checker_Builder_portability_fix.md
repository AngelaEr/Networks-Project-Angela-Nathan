# Verification Log: Portability Fix
## Group_AN

**Date:** 2025-01-13
**Checker:** The Checker

## Issue Identified

During review, Checker asked: *"If another person runs this server on their PC and types `http://localhost:10000`, would it work?"*

**Answer: No.** Two hardcoded IP issues were found.

---

## What Was Checked

| File | Line | Problem Found |
|------|------|---------------|
| `server/server.py` | 23 | `HOST = '10.100.102.46'` - Server bound to specific IP |
| `client/script.js` | 24-25 | Hardcoded `HOST` and `PORT` variables |

---

## What Builder Fixed

### server/server.py:23
```python
# Before
HOST = '10.100.102.46'

# After
HOST = '0.0.0.0'  # Listen on all interfaces
```

### client/script.js:24-26
```javascript
// Before
HOST = '10.100.102.46'
PORT = '10000'
serverAddressInput.value = window.location.host || 'http://' + HOST + ':' + PORT;

// After (removed HOST/PORT, simplified default)
serverAddressInput.value = window.location.host || 'localhost:10000';
```

---

## Re-Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Server HOST = '0.0.0.0' | VERIFIED |
| Client uses 'localhost:10000' fallback | VERIFIED |

---

## Additional Issue: Startup Message

**Problem:** Server printed `http://localhost:10000` which doesn't work for other devices.

### server/server.py - Added get_local_ip() function
```python
def get_local_ip():
    """Get the local IP address of this machine."""
    try:
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
        s.connect(("8.8.8.8", 80))
        local_ip = s.getsockname()[0]
        s.close()
        return local_ip
    except Exception:
        return "localhost"
```

### Startup message updated
```python
# Before
print(f"[*] Open http://localhost:{PORT} in your browser")

# After
local_ip = get_local_ip()
print(f"[*] Open: http://{local_ip}:{PORT}")
```

**Result:** Server now displays the actual IP for easy copy-paste:
```
[*] Chat Server started on 0.0.0.0:10000
[*] Open: http://10.100.102.34:10000
[*] Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

## Final Result

**PASSED** - Server works on any machine and displays correct URL for network access.
